# Movie Recommendation using Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a technique that filters out items that a user might like based on the reactions of other similar users. It works by searching out a large group of users and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. Items that users like are combined into a ranked list of suggestions.

# Dataset
GroupLens Research has collected and made available the MovieLens dataset. Here, I am using a subset of this MovieLens dataset. The movies.csv is a 9743 rows x 3 columns dataset. The ratings.csv is a 100837 rows x 4 columns.
